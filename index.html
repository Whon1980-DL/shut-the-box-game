                <h3>How To Play<h3>
                <p>To start, a player roll the dice by clicking the Roll Dice button then add up the total of their roll. 
                    They then lower 1 or more tiles that equal the total they rolled. For example, 
                    if a player rolled a 4 and a 3, their total is 7. 
                    Therefore, they could choose to lower one of the following tile combinations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>7</li>
                    <li>4 & 3</li>
                    <li>5 & 2</li>
                    <li>6 & 1</li>
                    <li>4, 2 & 1</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After lowering the tile(s), the player continues to roll the dice and lower tiles until they reach the point where no tiles correspond with the total they roll. F
                    or example, if the total of a player’s roll is 6 and only the 7 and 2 tiles remain upright, they’re unable to lower any tiles and their turn is over. 
                    Once a player’s turn is over, the next player starts their turn with all of the tiles in the upright position. This continues until each player has taken one turn.
                </p><br>
                <p>Players add the total of any upright tiles at the end of their turn to their score. The player with the lowest score wins!
                </p>
